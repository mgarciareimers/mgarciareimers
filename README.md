### Welcome to my Github profile!

Hi there 👋, 

I am Miguel García Reimers, a Chemical Engineer ⚗️ who decided to pursue his passion on programming and make it as a living. Thanks to that decision, I am currently working as a freelance full-time Software Engineer (and it has been so since 2019). You can find my main projects in [Malt](https://www.malt.es/profile/mgarciareimers).

I am also Co-Founder together with [Jorge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorgegpalacios/) of Spotshot App, the best mobile app to find the greatest spots to take pictures or shoot videos: the app has been developed in Flutter for both Android and iOS and the API in NodeJS. You can find more [here](https://www.instagram.com/spotshot_app).

I work in both front and backend sides and my main technologies/programming languages (right now) are:

- Android (👀 Java): I know, right now Kotlin is the king but... I 💚 Java.
- Flutter (Dart): New as it is, I 🧡 this multi-platform programming language!
- NodeJS & Typescript ✨: The combination of both of them is so magical...

Although I am really busy now (hope to not to be soon) 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project related to the technologies mentioned above.

**Wanna reach me?** 📫 Just email me to mgarciareimers@gmail.com

Cheers,

@mgarciareimers
